# ECE373-Project
Final Project for ECE 373 of Fall 2021:

Arcade style, "Bird's Eye View", Zombie Shooter Game.
Heavily inspired by Call of Duty World at War "Nazi Zombies" with it's fantastic atmosphere.

Notes:
1) Please don't copy 'directly' if you are taking ECE373 or some other related class. All ideas however can be used for your individual projects.

2) Any modification, private use, or "remaster" is fully open and freely encouraged. Also would love to hear new ideas, modifications, improvements, etc...

3) All sounds were 'dumped' from Call of Duty World at War PC (under fair use or something like that so pls no legal stuff).

4) Current game still in development, expect a fair amount of bugs/glitches. New features will be implemented along the way.

5) To play, import the java project/source folder into a Java compiler. Will create a jar executable in a future update and/or git command line installers for fun.

6) I have noticed that Java Development Kits within Linux seem to be picky about audio file formats (this includes older Linux JDKs).
   Windows XP -> 10 & MacOS seem to have no issues interestingly.
   Most of the audio files from the Cod WaW sound dump were originally in non-standard formats with very random sample rates.
   Some of the audio files used in my game weren't corrected due to how long it takes to reformat a file ... "correctly". Will eventually fix; but low on list of         priorities.
