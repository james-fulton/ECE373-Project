# ECE373-Project
Final Project for ECE 373:

Arcade Style Zombie Shooter Game
Inspired by Call of Duty World at War "Nazi Zombies"

Developed with the Eclipse Java IDE

Notes:
1) Please do not copy 'directly' if you are taking ECE373 or a Java class. All ideas however can be used for your individual projects.

2) Any modification, private use, or "remaster" is open and freely encouraged. Also would love to hear new ideas.

3) All sounds were 'dumped' from Call of Duty World at War (under fair use or something like that).
